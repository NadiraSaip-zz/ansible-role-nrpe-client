When you need to monitor multiple machines, itâ€™s a lot of work to install each machine manually.  Instead, you want to run just a single command, or click a few buttons, to configure all those machines at once, and then keep them updated over time.  This can be achieved with a bash script, so why bother to use Ansible?  The main reason is simplicity.  Bash scripts tend to be long, unreadable and unwieldy, while Ansible provides a powerful set of modules that can be used to perform the most common tasks in just few lines of self-explanatory code.  Another important reason is that Ansible is agentless, using OpenSSH to execute tasks on remote machines.
